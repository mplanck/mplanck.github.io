The goal is to become a living document and a resource for the VR story telling community.</h3></div><div class="row"><div class="banner-space"></div><a name="lostlessons"></a><a href="./storystudio_files/#" data-featherlight="images/whyvr-banner.jpg" class="poster"><img src="./storystudio_files/whyvr-banner.jpg"></a><div class="banner-space"></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6"><p class="small bold">5 Mistakes While Making Lost</p><div class="blog-bio"><p class="small">By Saschka Unseld</p><p class="small">Director of Lost, Creative Director</p><p class="small">May 16th, 2015</p></div><p>At Oculus Story Studio – our mission is to inspire and educate. As part of this, we wanted to share some of the trials we went through in telling our first story in virtual reality, as well as share the many lessons we discovered in the process. </p><p>These are by no means the last word on storytelling in VR. These are not meant to be set in stone. Rather, this is what we struggled with, what worked for us, and what we strive to do in the future as we tell more stories in VR.</p><h3>1. Rushing the pacing</h3><p>When we started hashing out the story, we edited together a classic film reel of the whole story to map out the pacing. Putting that same timing into a VR experience made the action feel rushed and caused everyone to be confused. The density of information that you could convey in film vs VR was clearly different.</p><p>Rather than thinking about the story as a series of actions a character takes, we ended up thinking about the story as a series of moments that we are in. Ex.: We are in a dark forest by ourselves, a massive robot hand searches for someone, the hand sits alone and disappointed, the hand waits for something that approaches, etc… </p><p>We then paced these out in VR to make sure we spend enough time in each moment. Structuring Lost this way helped us slow down the pacing without losing our story structure.</p><h3>2. Underestimating the ritual of “Settling in &amp; Setting the scene”</h3><p>In cinema there is a clearly defined ritual before a film starts. We go to a cinema, we get settled into our seats, the lights dim, the curtains open, the title credits start, the music starts, and we let go and become ready to listen to a story. In VR no ritual exists that we can build upon. Every time we showed someone early versions of Lost the person felt strangely dumped into the forest. Being put into a completely new environment is something jarring, especially with such an abundance of detail in the set suddenly put in front of you.</p><p>So with VR, especially because it is so amazing, we needed to find that ritual of “settling in and setting the scene.” The first part of that challenge was figuring out what would be the very first thing we would see, something we call “the in.” We wanted to find something that took the audience by the hand and step by step showed them the world of VR instead of dumping them directly into the set and overwhelming them.</p><p>We started talking about having the firefly be the first thing the viewer meets, even before the viewer enters into the forest. This way we had something small, simple, and graspable that got people’s attention. The firefly flies a bit to your left and to right so that the viewer gets used to the concept of looking left and right. Only after this do we finally open up to the setting our story takes place in.</p><h3>3. Forcing the viewer to look somewhere</h3><p>We talked endlessly about how to regain the control we were used to in film. How could we make sure the viewer always looks in the “right” direction? We tried making viewers look at a certain place through audio cues. We had something fly by the viewer and guide her gaze. We tried to design the set in a way that helps the viewer to look in the right place. However, every time we implemented one of these dictatorial tools too heavy handedly, the storytelling started to feel forced, staged, and artificial.</p><p></p></div><div class="col-sm-6"><a href="./storystudio_files/#" data-featherlight="images/lost-hand.png" class="poster"><img src="./storystudio_files/lost-hand.png"></a><p>Over time we tried to step away from this sort of thinking. We decided that if we truly wanted to embrace the uniqueness of VR as its own medium, we had to let go of our almighty control of what the audience sees. Instead of pushing the story onto the viewer, we took a step back and let the viewer take part in discovering the story herself. We call this “the letting-go.”</p><p>By not forcing the viewer to look somewhere and making the surroundings interesting in all directions, we tried to incite the viewer's curiosity in the world and through this have her take a more active role in experiencing the story. We give you time to look wherever you want and get used to where you are. After 40 seconds or so, a time we felt was enough for most people to feel settled and relaxed, we start our story.</p><h3>4. Too singular of storytelling</h3><p>If only one thing happens in VR at any given time, as is the case in film, the world quickly starts to feel empty and strangely fake. In life there is rarely ever just one thing happening around us. To truly have a VR experience give us the sense of reality, and thus a sense of presence, we need to go beyond singular storytelling.</p><p>We eventually redefined the relationship between storyteller, listener, and the story itself. Even though time for the viewer unfolds in a linear fashion, the discovery of the story might not. This realization, of course, had big implications on staging and timing. It also sparked something I'd like to call "spatial story density".</p><p>In VR there should never be just one interesting story related thing to look at. Stories and storytelling should be as three dimensional as the space around us. At any given moment we need to make sure that there is a certain amount of density of story elements in the space around us.</p><h3>5. Setting ourselves up to fail</h3><p>Telling stories in real-time CG is hard. We are rendering two 1Kx1K resolution frames (one per eye) at 90 frames per second. Whereas a single frame of a classical animated movie may take days to compute on a single computer, we need to compute our frames at one ninetieth of a second. Even the most advanced computers are barely able to do this today.</p><p>When Pixar did the first Toy Story they wisely choose to do only toys. No humans, hair, water, or cloth. They knew that doing these things at a high quality level was not yet possible, and they wanted to make sure they set themselves up for a project with achievable goals.</p><p>We did not do this. A complex environment like a forest might be achievable in animated films, but in VR it was a mountain that was not surmountable. We had to restrict ourselves massively in order to make the experience smooth and still look good. In hindsight, a simpler environment would have saved us a lot of headache.</p><p>We are, of course, painfully aware that we weren't able to implement everything we learned while working on Lost. But to a certain extent this is beside the point of a first step. A first step is about learning, about discovering, about finishing, and then taking the lessons we learned into the next project. It is, for us, also about sharing these discoveries with the world so that everyone can build upon what we have found.</p></div></div><div class="row"><hr></div></div></div></section> <section class="content-15 v-center"><div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6"><div class="blog-bio"><p class="small bold">Why VR Storytelling?</p><p class="small">By Jeff Brown</p><p class="small">Director of Photography</p><p class="small">April 13th, 2015</p></div><p>We've spent our entire careers transporting audiences through visual storytelling.  This is our language, a vocabulary we've developed and become accustomed to.  In a sense, virtual realities are what we've been creating all along.  But if that’s the case, what are we doing here at Story Studio?  Why are we so attracted to this new medium?</p><p>Every time I visit a virtual world I’m overwhelmed by possibilities.  The far-reaching creative implications of actually feeling like you’re somewhere else are palpable, entirely transformative and obvious.  That’s the easy part.  Now we have to learn how to do this right.</p><p>Stories are told through tons of different mediums and the craft has been in a state of evolution as long as we have.  Cave paintings, campfires, stage plays, opera, books, movies and games among many others. The truth is, these formats are often non-interchangeable.  It’s the reason why great books can make such lousy movies-- all the detail of those beautifully written chapters is lost when crammed into just 90 minutes.  Story is best told in its intended format—The same is true for VR.</p><p>What sets VR apart is the feeling of being present. This creates an entirely new set of opportunities and creative constraints. We believe our environments, characters and situations should be better suited for virtual reality then they would be anywhere else.  This is easier said than done, as you might imagine.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6"><a href="./storystudio_files/#" data-featherlight="images/lost-hand.png" class="poster"><img src="./storystudio_files/lost-hand.png"></a><p>Our first short film “Lost” was a chance for us to dive in and work out the challenges of telling a story in VR, everything from using traditional film techniques to scene staging and the many ways to grab the viewer’s attention. We’ll be covering these topics and others in future posts.</p><p>In the meantime, just know that storytelling has a new vehicle and we couldn't be more excited about the possibilities.  We’re fully aware that our stories must support the medium.  Because of this, we began asking ourselves “Why VR?” as part of our development process.  Why is this story better told in this medium?  What can we do to leverage the strengths of VR?  Its been helping us stay true to our goal— to build truly immersive cinematic experiences that were never before possible.</p></div></div><div class="row"><hr></div></div></div></section><section class="content-15 v-center"><a name="firstblog"></a><div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6"><div class="blog-bio"><p class="small bold">Breadcrumbs - a first blog post</p><p class="small">By Max Planck</p><p class="small">Supervising Technical Director</p><p class="small">January 26th, 2015</p></div><p>A year ago, those of us at Oculus Story Studio were on different career paths working in computer animated films and story driven games. Like most creators and artists who have seen modern virtual reality, we knew this emerging platform was not just a new gaming device, but a powerful new medium. So we changed course, quit our jobs, and started down a path of using this medium to immerse the audience into fantastic worlds and deeply meaningful stories using realtime rendering.  I left Pixar after 10 years, looking for the next step, the next evolution in story telling: when I saw Oculus' internal prototype, I found what I was looking for.  We all had similar moments when we were convinced and became believers.</p><p>Those of us story tellers venturing into VR sometimes feel like explorers cutting our way through a dense, overgrown, uncharted forest, and the deeper we get into the forest, the more profound of an experience we give our audience.</p><p>Being with Oculus, we are in a unique position: it is in our best interest to share our process as well as our end product. And so it is our mission to leave breadcrumbs behind as we progress through this forest, marking dead ends and sand traps, and saving our fellow explorers the time they could be using to help us all find new paths.</p><p>Here we are at Year Zero of modern VR, releasing our first realtime, interactive short experience called "Lost" in Park City, Utah during Sundance 2015, trying to tell stories in a medium new to story tellers.  As much as we are proud of this first step, we know that it is just a beginning, and we're excited by the journey ahead.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6"><a href="./storystudio_files/#" data-featherlight="images/lost-poster-adjusted.jpg" class="poster"><img src="./storystudio_files/lost-poster-adjusted.jpg"></a><p>Like the stage directors and show men who converted to the first film makers, we find ourselves using a lot of the techniques and language that we bring with us from our previous lives. We often catch ourselves making the same type of mistake over and over again, assuming what we know in film and games will easily transfer to VR. It will be through serendipitous discovery and inventive mutations that Oculus Story Studio and the many VR story makers will start finding and sharing the narrative devices that will make VR story telling special.</p><p>These blog posts are written by the team members of Oculus Story Studio, discussing our failures and successes, our technology and our wishlists, our opinions and what excites us.</p><p>These blog posts will be our breadcrumbs.</p></div></div></div></div></section><link href="./storystudio_files/slim-081711.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><section class="content-13 subscribe-form bg-black"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div id="mc_embed_signup"><form id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank" novalidate="true" class="validate"><div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll"><div class="col-sm-9"><label for="mce-EMAIL">Get Story Studio Updates:</label><input id="mce-EMAIL" type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" placeholder="Enter email here" required="required" class="email"><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;"><input type="text" name="b_5fb095ae9b96c44a474479e6a_f4cc2f9513" tabindex="-1" value=""></div></div><div class="col-sm-3"><div class="clear"><input id="mc-embedded-subscribe" type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" class="button"></div></div></div></form></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer-2 bg-black"><div class="container"><div class="additional-links"><a href="https://www.oculus.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a><a href="mailto:contacts@oculusstorystudio.com">Contact Us</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/oculusstorystudio">Facebook</a><a href="https://twitter.com/ovrstorystudio">Twitter</a><a href="http://vimeo.com/oculusstorystudio">Vimeo</a></div></div></footer></div><script src="./storystudio_files/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="./storystudio_files/vendor.js"></script><script src="./storystudio_files/app.js"></script><script>app = require('scripts/story');</script><script id="hiddenlpsubmitdiv" style="display: none;"></script><script>try{for(var lastpass_iter=0; lastpass_iter < document.forms.length; lastpass_iter++){ var lastpass_f = document.forms[lastpass_iter]; if(typeof(lastpass_f.lpsubmitorig2)=="undefined"){ lastpass_f.lpsubmitorig2 = lastpass_f.submit; if (typeof(lastpass_f.lpsubmitorig2)=='object'){ continue;}lastpass_f.submit = function(){ var form=this; var customEvent = document.createEvent("Event"); customEvent.initEvent("lpCustomEvent", true, true); var d = document.getElementById("hiddenlpsubmitdiv"); if (d) {for(var i = 0; i < document.forms.length; i++){ if(document.forms[i]==form){ if (typeof(d.innerText) != 'undefined') { d.innerText=i; } else { d.textContent=i; } } } d.dispatchEvent(customEvent); }form.lpsubmitorig2(); } } }}catch(e){}</script></body></html>
