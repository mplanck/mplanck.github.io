As part of this, we wanted to share five of the lessons we learned out of the mistakes we made while creating our first virtual reality story, Lost.</p><p>These lessons are by no means rules set in stone; rather, they’re suggestions for others who are just beginning to learn the language and grammar of storytelling in VR.</p><a href="http://www1-stage.oculus.com/storystudio/#" data-featherlight="images/saschka-tribeca-lost-2.jpg" style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:8px" class="poster"><img src="./Oculus Story Studio_files/saschka-tribeca-lost-2.jpg" class="lost-poster"></a><p style="font-size:small" class="caption">Saschka Unseld presenting lessons learned while making Lost<br> at the Tribeca Film Festival 2015.</p><h3>1. Rushing the pacing</h3><p>Traditionally when hashing out a story, we edit together a storyboarded film reel to map out the actions and pacing. But when we did this to pace out the timing of the actions in VR, it made everything feel rushed and caused confusion with our audience. </p><p>In hindsight this makes a lot of sense. The density of information that is conveyed in film versus VR is clearly different.</p><p>That is why, rather than thinking about the story as a series of “actions” a character takes, we ended up thinking about the story as a series of “moments”. As an example: 1. We are alone in a dark forest 2. A massive robot hand searches the area 3. The hand sits down alone disappointed 4. The Hand waits for something that approaches etc…</p><p>We then paced these moments out in VR to make sure that we’re spending enough time in each moment so that the audience has time to comprehend each moment of our story. Structuring Lost through thinking of it as “moments” and not “actions” helped find the right pace without losing our story structure.</p><hr><h3>2. Underestimating the ritual of “Settling in &amp; Setting the scene”</h3><p>In early versions of Lost, the audience often noted that they were confused and overwhelmed when they first saw the forest. Being transported to a completely new environment can be startling, especially with such a rich and beautiful place.</p><p>In cinema, there is a clearly defined ritual before a film starts: we get settled into our seats, the lights dim, the curtains open, and we let go, ready to be taken elsewhere.</p><p>But in VR, no such ritual exists. We needed to find a ritual for “settling in and setting the scene”.</p><p>The first part of this was figuring out what would be the very first thing the audience would see. This “first thing” is something we now call “The In”. For Lost we wanted to find something that took the audience by the hand and step by step, led them into the world rather than of just dropping  them directly into the set and risking to overwhelm them.</p><p>Our “In” in Lost became Fi the firefly. She is the first thing the audience sees, even before entering into the forest. This way we had something small, simple, and graspable that got people’s attention. Fi flies a bit to your left and to right so that the audience gets used to the concept of looking all around them. Only after Fi’s greeting do we open up to the setting our story takes place in, the mysterious forest at night.</p><hr><h3>3. Forcing the viewer to look somewhere</h3><p>One of the most powerful aspects of film is the total control over the shot. We talked endlessly about how to regain that control. How could we make sure the viewer always looks in the correct direction? </p><p>We tried guiding  the audience’s view through audio cues. We had a bird fly by the viewer to capture their attention and guide their gaze towards a point in the scene. We also tried to design the set in a way that guides the viewers gaze to the right areas.</p><p>However, each time we implemented one of these dictatorial tools too heavy handedly, the storytelling started to feel forced, staged, and artificial.</p><p>Over time we stepped away from this sort of thinking. To embrace VR as its own unique medium, we have to let go of our almighty control of what the audience sees. Instead of instantly pushing the story onto the viewer, we take a step back for a while and let the viewer take part in discovering the story themselves. We call this “The Letting-Go”.</p><p>By not forcing the viewer to look somewhere and making the surroundings interesting in all directions, we incite the viewer's curiosity in the world. And through this curiosity, have them take a more active role in experiencing the story. We give the audience time to look wherever they want and get used to where they are. Then, after 40 seconds or so, a time we felt was enough for most people to feel settled and relaxed, we start utilizing things like the bird to get the audience’s attention back. But by now, because we gave them time to settle in, they are willing to listen to us.</p><hr><h3>4. Too singular of storytelling</h3><p>If only one thing happens in VR at any given time, as is the case in film, the world quickly starts to feel empty and strangely fake. In life there is rarely ever just one thing happening around us. To truly have a VR experience give us the sense of reality, and thus a sense of presence, we need to go beyond singular storytelling.</p><p>We eventually redefined the relationship between storyteller, listener, and the story itself. Even though time for the viewer unfolds in a linear fashion, the discovery of the story might not. This realization, of course, had big implications on staging and timing. It also sparked discussion around something we call "Spatial Story Density".</p><p>In VR there should never be just one interesting story related thing to look at. Stories and storytelling should be as three dimensional as the space around us. At any given moment we need to make sure that there is a certain amount of density of story elements in the space around us. </p><p>We slightly did this in Lost with the details of the forest around you and the moon up in the sky. But in future project I want us to embrace this three dimensionality even more.</p><hr><h3>5. Setting ourselves up to fail</h3><p>Telling stories in real-time CG is hard. Not just creatively but also technically. We are rendering approximately two 1Kx1K resolution frames (one per eye) at 90 frames per second. Whereas a single frame of a classical animated movie may take days to compute on a single computer, we need to compute our frames at one ninetieth of a second. Even the most advanced computers are barely able to do this today.</p><p>When Pixar did the first Toy Story they wisely choose to do only toys. No humans, hair, water, or cloth. They knew that doing these things at a high quality level was not yet possible, and they wanted to make sure they set themselves up for a project with achievable goals.</p><p>We did not do this. A complex environment like a forest might be achievable in animated films, but in VR it was a challenge that took more time from us to surmountable then we had hoped. We had to restrict ourselves massively in order to make the experience smooth and still look good. In hindsight, a simpler environment would have saved us a lot of headache.</p><hr><p>We are, of course, painfully aware that we weren't able to implement everything we learned while working on Lost. But to a certain extent this is beside the point of a first step. A first step is about learning, about discovering, about finishing, and then taking the lessons we learned into the next project. Lost was Story Studio's first step.</p><p>We hope that these lessons help other storytellers in taking their own first step into VR.</p></div></div><div class="row"><hr></div></div></div></section> <section class="content-15 v-center"><a name="whyvr"></a><div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6"><div class="blog-bio"><p class="small bold">Why VR Storytelling?</p><p class="small">By Jeff Brown</p><p class="small">Director of Photography</p><p class="small">April 13th, 2015</p></div><p>We've spent our entire careers transporting audiences through visual storytelling.  This is our language, a vocabulary we've developed and become accustomed to.  In a sense, virtual realities are what we've been creating all along.  But if that’s the case, what are we doing here at Story Studio?  Why are we so attracted to this new medium?</p><p>Every time I visit a virtual world I’m overwhelmed by possibilities.  The far-reaching creative implications of actually feeling like you’re somewhere else are palpable, entirely transformative and obvious.  That’s the easy part.  Now we have to learn how to do this right.</p><p>Stories are told through tons of different mediums and the craft has been in a state of evolution as long as we have.  Cave paintings, campfires, stage plays, opera, books, movies and games among many others. The truth is, these formats are often non-interchangeable.  It’s the reason why great books can make such lousy movies-- all the detail of those beautifully written chapters is lost when crammed into just 90 minutes.  Story is best told in its intended format—The same is true for VR.</p><p>What sets VR apart is the feeling of being present. This creates an entirely new set of opportunities and creative constraints. We believe our environments, characters and situations should be better suited for virtual reality then they would be anywhere else.  This is easier said than done, as you might imagine.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6"><a href="http://www1-stage.oculus.com/storystudio/#" data-featherlight="images/lost-hand.png" class="poster"><img src="./Oculus Story Studio_files/lost-hand.png"></a><p>Our first short film “Lost” was a chance for us to dive in and work out the challenges of telling a story in VR, everything from using traditional film techniques to scene staging and the many ways to grab the viewer’s attention. We’ll be covering these topics and others in future posts.</p><p>In the meantime, just know that storytelling has a new vehicle and we couldn't be more excited about the possibilities.  We’re fully aware that our stories must support the medium.  Because of this, we began asking ourselves “Why VR?” as part of our development process.  Why is this story better told in this medium?  What can we do to leverage the strengths of VR?  Its been helping us stay true to our goal— to build truly immersive cinematic experiences that were never before possible.</p></div></div><div class="row"><hr></div></div></div></section><section class="content-15 v-center"><a name="firstblog"></a><div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6"><div class="blog-bio"><p class="small bold">Breadcrumbs - a first blog post</p><p class="small">By Max Planck</p><p class="small">Supervising Technical Director</p><p class="small">January 26th, 2015</p></div><p>A year ago, those of us at Oculus Story Studio were on different career paths working in computer animated films and story driven games. Like most creators and artists who have seen modern virtual reality, we knew this emerging platform was not just a new gaming device, but a powerful new medium. So we changed course, quit our jobs, and started down a path of using this medium to immerse the audience into fantastic worlds and deeply meaningful stories using realtime rendering.  I left Pixar after 10 years, looking for the next step, the next evolution in story telling: when I saw Oculus' internal prototype, I found what I was looking for.  We all had similar moments when we were convinced and became believers.</p><p>Those of us story tellers venturing into VR sometimes feel like explorers cutting our way through a dense, overgrown, uncharted forest, and the deeper we get into the forest, the more profound of an experience we give our audience.</p><p>Being with Oculus, we are in a unique position: it is in our best interest to share our process as well as our end product. And so it is our mission to leave breadcrumbs behind as we progress through this forest, marking dead ends and sand traps, and saving our fellow explorers the time they could be using to help us all find new paths.</p><p>Here we are at Year Zero of modern VR, releasing our first realtime, interactive short experience called "Lost" in Park City, Utah during Sundance 2015, trying to tell stories in a medium new to story tellers.  As much as we are proud of this first step, we know that it is just a beginning, and we're excited by the journey ahead.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6"><a href="http://www1-stage.oculus.com/storystudio/#" data-featherlight="images/lost-poster-adjusted.jpg" class="poster"><img src="./Oculus Story Studio_files/lost-poster-adjusted.jpg"></a><p>Like the stage directors and show men who converted to the first film makers, we find ourselves using a lot of the techniques and language that we bring with us from our previous lives. We often catch ourselves making the same type of mistake over and over again, assuming what we know in film and games will easily transfer to VR. It will be through serendipitous discovery and inventive mutations that Oculus Story Studio and the many VR story makers will start finding and sharing the narrative devices that will make VR story telling special.</p><p>These blog posts are written by the team members of Oculus Story Studio, discussing our failures and successes, our technology and our wishlists, our opinions and what excites us.</p><p>These blog posts will be our breadcrumbs.</p></div></div></div></div></section><link href="./Oculus Story Studio_files/slim-081711.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><section class="content-13 subscribe-form bg-black"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div id="mc_embed_signup"><form id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank" novalidate="true" class="validate"><div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll"><div class="col-sm-9"><label for="mce-EMAIL">Get Story Studio Updates:</label><input id="mce-EMAIL" type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" placeholder="Enter email here" required="required" class="email"><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;"><input type="text" name="b_5fb095ae9b96c44a474479e6a_f4cc2f9513" tabindex="-1" value=""></div></div><div class="col-sm-3"><div class="clear"><input id="mc-embedded-subscribe" type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" class="button"></div></div></div></form></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer-2 bg-black"><div class="container"><div class="additional-links"><a href="https://www.oculus.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a><a href="mailto:contacts@oculusstorystudio.com">Contact Us</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/oculusstorystudio">Facebook</a><a href="https://twitter.com/ovrstorystudio">Twitter</a><a href="http://vimeo.com/oculusstorystudio">Vimeo</a></div></div></footer></div><script src="./Oculus Story Studio_files/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="./Oculus Story Studio_files/vendor.js"></script><script src="./Oculus Story Studio_files/app.js"></script><script>app = require('scripts/story');</script><script id="hiddenlpsubmitdiv" style="display: none;"></script><script>try{for(var lastpass_iter=0; lastpass_iter < document.forms.length; lastpass_iter++){ var lastpass_f = document.forms[lastpass_iter]; if(typeof(lastpass_f.lpsubmitorig2)=="undefined"){ lastpass_f.lpsubmitorig2 = lastpass_f.submit; if (typeof(lastpass_f.lpsubmitorig2)=='object'){ continue;}lastpass_f.submit = function(){ var form=this; var customEvent = document.createEvent("Event"); customEvent.initEvent("lpCustomEvent", true, true); var d = document.getElementById("hiddenlpsubmitdiv"); if (d) {for(var i = 0; i < document.forms.length; i++){ if(document.forms[i]==form){ if (typeof(d.innerText) != 'undefined') { d.innerText=i.toString(); } else { d.textContent=i.toString(); } } } d.dispatchEvent(customEvent); }form.lpsubmitorig2(); } } }}catch(e){}</script></body></html>
